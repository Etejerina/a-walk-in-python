## **Functions**

___

A **function** is a series of statements wich returns some value to a caller. It can also be passed zero or more arguments, wich may be used in the execution of this block of code, or body of the function.

> A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.

Having said that, in Python functions signature, are called arguments, or *args* for short.

Functions use the reserved word *def*, as follows.

```python
def a_function(arguments):
    # some code
    return some_value
```

And the function can be called this way:

```python
a_function()
```
