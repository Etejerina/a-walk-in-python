## Data types in details

Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Text Type: ***str***

* Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
'hello' is the same as "hello".
You can display a string literal with the print() function.

Numeric Types: ***int, float, complex***

* Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
* Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals. Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
* Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part.

Sequence Types: ***list, tuple***

* Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data.
Lists are created using square brackets.

* Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
Tuples are written with round brackets.

Mapping Type: ***dict***

* Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Set Types: ***set, frozenset***

* Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
* Frozenset is just an inmutable version of a set.

Boolean Type: ***bool***

* In programming you often need to know if an expression is True or False. Those are boolean values.
